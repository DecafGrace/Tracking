# Tracking
Project for Creative Programming II 

For this project, a type of video tracking called optical flow was used to track if there were chnages between the frames, meaning that there was movement on the screen.  This filter here has a lavender background (like my room), and puts letters on a grid across the screen. These letters are set to change after a certain amount of time, to eventually spell my name.  The colors of the letters are based on the pixels at the x and y on which they are placed, and the size is somewhat based on brightness, which can be approximated by the red value of the pixel at that point, and mapping it to text size.
